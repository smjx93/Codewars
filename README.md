# Codewars

**Why** 
I needed a repository filled with codewars challenges (kata) because everyday the first thing I do is solve a Codewar.

**How it's made**
Tech used -- JavaScript

**Optimizations** 
I consistently refactor and optimize my code. Sometimes for efficiency and sometimes for readability. 

**Lessons Learned** 
The biggest lesson I learned in tackling the seemingly endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay. The point is to consistently take initiative to improve.
