// Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number 
// passed into it and then sums the results together.

// For example, for [1, 2, 2] should return 9 because 
// 1*1 + 2*2 + 2*2 = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9


function squareSum(numbers){
    return numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num * num, 0);
}

// The squareSum function takes an array of numbers as input, and 
// returns the sum of the squares of the numbers in the array. 
// The reduce method is used to sum up the squares of the numbers. 
// The sum variable represents the running total, and num * num is the
// square of the current number being processed. The 0 argument passed 
// to reduce is the initial value of the sum variable. 
// If the input array is empty, the reduce method will return 
// the initial value, which is 0 in this case.
