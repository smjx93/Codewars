/* Since we cannot define keywords in Javascript (well, at least I don't
know how to do it), your task is to define a function xor(a, b) 
where a and b are the two expressions to be evaluated. 
Your xor function should have the behaviour described above, 
returning true if exactly one of the two expressions evaluate
to true, false otherwise. */


function xor(a, b) {
    return (a && !b) || (!a && b);
  }
  

/* This implementation uses the logical && and ! (not) operators to check the 
truthiness of a and b, and then returns true if exactly one of them is true, 
and false otherwise.*/
