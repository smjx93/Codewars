/* You ask a small girl,"How old are you?" She always says, "x years old", 
where x is a random number between 0 and 9.

Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.

Assume the test input string is always a valid string. 
For example, the test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old".
The first character in the string is always a number. */

function getAge(inputString) {
  const ageString = inputString.charAt(0); // extract the first character
  const age = parseInt(ageString); // convert the character to an integer
  return age; // return the girl's age as an integer
}

/* charAt(0) method to extract the first character from the input string. 
Since the girl always says her age in the format "x years old", 
where x is the age, the first character in the string represents
the girl's age. */
