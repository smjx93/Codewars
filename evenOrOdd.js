/* Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and 
returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.*/

const evenOrOdd = number => number % 2 === 0 ? "Even" : "Odd";


/*When there's only one parameterthe parentheses can be omitted
The ternary statement checks if the remainder of the number 
divided by 2 is equal to 0 (i.e., the number is even), and 
returns "Even". Otherwise, it returns "Odd" if the number is odd.
